# Giving-Contract
### What is Phat Doge Givings
We believe that giving and charities should be FUN and can be powered by the people and their meme tokens.

### Phat Reflections
We are a true charity token with a new GIVING protocol who is primarily solving the case for hunger globally while making your wallets PHAT with BUSD. Earn 10% reflections on every buy/ sell given back to your wallet through our auto-claim protocol. (min hold 10,000,000).

### Accountability
EVERY DAY, we will show you proof on this website that the money accumulated the day before goes directly to various charitable causes this community has selected. 3% of every transaction gets converted into BUSD and goes to the charity fund used only for giveaways. Come back here daily to see who has received money. This is also community driven and you can vote and donate to the charity that the community chooses. We encourage you to share as well.

### Why we care about hunger
World hunger is on the rise - Globally, about 8.9% of the world’s population — 690 million people — go to bed on an empty stomach each night. Since 2014, the number of people affected by hunger has been slowly on the rise. If it continues at this rate, it’ll exceed 840 million by 2030.

COVID is going to make it worse - Estimates suggest that an additional 83 million to 132 million more people will be chronically hungry due to the COVID.

Sub-Saharan Africa is still the region with the highest prevalence of undernourishment, estimated at 22% of the population.
